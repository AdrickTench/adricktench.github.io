I'm a PhD student in the [Text-to-Knowledge group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) at Ghent University's [IDLab](https://www.idlab.ugent.be/), co-supervised by Thomas Demeester and Chris Develder. My research focuses on developing neuro-symbolic information extraction techniques for clinical data. My research is funded by the [Flanders AI research program](https://www.flandersairesearch.be/en).

I hold a B.A. in Cognitive Science and an M.S. in Computer Science, both from Northwestern University. Prior to my fellowship at Ghent University, I worked for six years as a software developer on the [Cyc](https://cyc.com/) project.
